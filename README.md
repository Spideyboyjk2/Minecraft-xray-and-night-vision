I didnt create any of these i just wanted to share it with you guys.
I know how hard it is to find them.

They are put in the folder that says (XRAY AND NIGHT VISION.zip) because idk how else to put it.
When you click the file you have to click (view raw) and then the file will download
then once the file is downloaded extract it out of the folder and put it into minecraft.

works for 1.20 and up.

Enjoy

Also FULL CREDIT TO THE ACTUAL PEOPLE WHO MADE THESE
IDK WHO MADE THEM I GOT THEM OFF A GUY ON YOUTUBE.
